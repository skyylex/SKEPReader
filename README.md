ePub reader example for iOS based on the https://github.com/fedefrappi/AePubReader

AePubReader last commit was on 21 Aug 2012. It was a non-ARC project, that was updated to actual state. If you have any ideas - please contact me (contacts are listed at the bottom).

Project isn't fully complete and is not a solution for integration as a epub reader framework. But could bring some initial ideas to start creating epub reader in the iOS application.
