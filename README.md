ePub reader sample for iOS based on the https://github.com/fedefrappi/AePubReader

AePubReader last commit was on 21 Aug 2012. It was a non-ARC project, that was updated to actual state. If you have any ideas - please contact me (contacts are listed at the bottom).

Project isn't fully complete and is not a solution for integration as a epub reader framework. But could bring some initial ideas to start creating epub reader in the iOS application.

#### Book sources

All sources and compile tools were get from https://github.com/IDPF/epub3-samples 
Books are used only for testing purpose.
